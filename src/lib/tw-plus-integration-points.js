 * How this fork consults the integration the distributing host supplied.
 *

 * and merges them, and each takes the integration as an argument rather than reading it, so a test
 * can hand one in and every call site stays a single line.
 *
 * Every point is optional. With nothing supplied each helper returns its input unchanged, which is
 * what makes opening a point safe on its own: the GUI keeps doing exactly what it did, and the
 * implementation moves across later, one at a time.
