/**
 * Where a project's extensions are loaded, and who decides how.
 *
 * None of that is this fork's: which Loader packages are used, what the archive limits are, what
 * asks the user, which switch turns the loader on and what counts as already trusted are all
 * decisions about a distribution. The distributing host answers the socket; what comes back is
 * disposed of here, and with no host there is simply no Plus extension loading.
 *
 * What is handed over is what only this fork has. Marking an error as an extension failure goes as
 * a function, because the project-error paths read it back. The VM modules the registration needs
 * go as this fork's own
 * module instances: `central-dispatch` is a singleton, and a copy resolved anywhere else would not
 * be the one the VM uses. The startup query goes as a value; what it means is the host's to decide.
